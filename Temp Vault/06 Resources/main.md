### Workflow for Resources

1. **Add a resource** to the appropriate subfolder  
   - Example: a PDF paper → `06 Resources/PDFs/`  
   - Example: an Excalidraw diagram → `06 Resources/Drawings/`  
2. **Embed resources** in your notes using Markdown:  
   - Images: `![[Images/example.png]]`  
   - Excalidraw: `![[Drawings/TreeDiagram.excalidraw]]`  
   - PDFs / documents: `[[PDFs/ResearchPaper.pdf]]`  
3. **Reference resources** in Zettels, Literature Notes, or Projects to maintain context
