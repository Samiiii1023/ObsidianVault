### Workflow for Archiving

1. **Determine inactivity:**  
   - Project completed  
   - Zettel no longer relevant for active studies  
   - Literature note outdated  
2. **Move note/file to Archive folder:**  
   - Example: `03 Zettels/20250115-1010_OldAlgorithm.md` â†’ `10 Archive/Zettels/20250115-1010_OldAlgorithm.md`  
3. **Maintain links:**  
   - Do **not delete links** in active notes; archived notes remain searchable  
4. **Optional review:**  
   - Periodically check Archive for important insights to revive  


### Key Points

- Keeps **active vault clean** while preserving knowledge  
- Notes in Archive can **still be referenced**  
- Recommended subfolders: Zettels, Projects, Literature, Resources
